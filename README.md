## overloaded vehicle detection program

### 1) SETTINGS
   
 This program was written in python and our team shared code in google golab environment.  
 We used "Detectron2" of facebook, which is object detection model with ballon detection, and modified it to lose code's complexity.  
 And add "easyOCR", text image detection model.

The data that used for our project is uploaded in google drive in shared state.  
if you can't use this data, please contact us or you can use the 'jpg' images for train and test.

### 2) How to use
First, you have to install Anaconda environment and install pytorch to use easyOCR.  
Second, download the training data and test data in google drive.

We are versioning our code through the detect_overload directory.  
You can download the final version of the code in that directory or visit the link, and run the code in colab environment.  
if you want to change the data, make a folder of jpg images and change the program's directory code.

### 3) Distribution and Copyleft
We used object detecion model "Detectron2" by Facebook and Text Image detection model "easyOCR" by JaideAI.
